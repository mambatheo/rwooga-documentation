# Executive Summary

**Company** : Rwooga (www.rwooga.com) 
**Project**: 3D Services & Portfolio Platform 
**Version**: 1.0 
**Date**: February 2026 

Rwooga is a creative studio offering professional 3D visualization, animation, custom design, and 3D printing services. This document covers the complete technical architecture, implementation details, API reference, security model, and operational guidelines for the platform.


## Problem Statement

Prior to this platform, Rwooga operated entirely through WhatsApp for client inquiries, custom requests, order placement, and file exchange. This approach created the following problems:

-	No structured storage for client files or design briefs.
-	Difficult to track pending requests and their status.
-	No professional portfolio to attract new clients.
-	No ability to process payments digitally.
-	Limited visibility and zero brand credibility online.

This platform replaces the ad-hoc process with a structured, scalable web solution.

## Proposed Solution

A premium mobile-first web platform combining a portfolio site, e-commerce store, custom design request engine, and a full admin dashboard. The platform supports online payments via MTN MoMo/Airtel, client-facing order tracking, and an admin-controlled service system.
